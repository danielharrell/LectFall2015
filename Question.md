## Introduction [intro]

Tonight, I want to ask a question about questions. What are
they, exactly? What did I just do in asking that one, for
example? Or that one? Or this one?

The questions I just asked show that they are easy enough to
form. And form them we do, in ways that range from the
clearly prosaic to the seemingly profound. What did you have
for lunch? Why is there something rather nothing?

Questions also have a central place at this college, in
their own way as important as the books we read and the
conversations we have. There is a reason we begin seminar
with an opening question rather than presentation. Or why we
call the occasion after Friday Night Lecture the Question
Period rather than the Answer Period, or even the
Question-And-Answer Period.  Without the questions we ask,
the books we read and the conversations we have would
arguably lose their point.

But their very importance can make questions invisible to
us.  They would get in the way themselves, it seems, if we
couldn't ask a question without having to ask, first, what
it means to ask a question. And if we consider questions our
best expressions of thoughtfulness, it is easy to focus on
what they ask, without any distinct reflection on what they
are.  One might even wonder if there is anything left in
a question to think about, once we grasp, and can ponder,
what the question is asking about.

But perhaps there *is* something left to think about. For
while questions may be invisible in one sense, they are
altogether visible in another. After all, we give questions
their own punctuation mark; their own syntax; their own
intonation; and even their own verb, making a question
something I *ask*, rather than simply something I say. It
even sounds odd, off, to say that questions are said, rather
than asked. But what is it, then, that makes asking
different from saying? What did I just do, for example, in
raising a question about this difference rather than making
an assertion about it? And what would make my question 
different from my answer, if I had any answer to
give? 

And *do* I have any answer to give? I ask this last
question, because I confess I can't make up my mind about
the lecture to follow, and what to make of where it goes.
I do know I've divided it into two parts. In the first part,
I will use my example of a clearly prosaic question---what
did you have for lunch?---to try to answer, if somewhat
simple-mindedly, the question of what questions are. But
even this simple-minded answer, I think, contains a paradox,
which I will try to describe. And in the second part of the
lecture, I will to try to resolve this paradox, but
with a suspicion I've only gotten stuck, by turning to my
example of a seemingly profound question---why is there
something rather than nothing? The lecture also has an
epilogue, which I'll read if I'm still within the hour by
then.   

## Part One

So, what did you have for lunch? I have a question about
this question. When I ask you what you had for lunch,
what is the word "what" referring to?

Here is my simple-minded answer: the word "what" must be
referring, somehow, to *what* you had for lunch.

I say "somehow", however, because even this simple an answer
can seem puzzling, once you think about it. For we can
suppose I have no idea what you had for lunch; if I did,
I wouldn't be asking you the question. But if I don't know
what you had, then how can I refer to what you had in my
question? In your answer, by contrast, you can easily refer
to what you had. For you know what this is, and can tell me.
But if you do tell me, you won't be saying you had *what*
for lunch, as if the word "what" could *identify* what you
had. You will instead say something like: I had pizza for
lunch. What is puzzling, then, is how pizza, in this case,
can be referred to, not simply by the word "pizza" in your
answer, but by the word "what" in my question. For in one
sense, at least, the word "what" refers to nothing: the 
nothing, so to speak, that is made into something by
the word "pizza", distinguishing my question about what you
had for lunch from your answer.  

But how can the word "what" refer to nothing, in this sense?
One way, perhaps, is by *pointing* to what you had for
lunch, but without identifying it. And this might make my
talk of nothing more sophistical than enlightening. But now
suppose I ask you: "So, what did you have for lunch?" And
you reply: "I had *this* for lunch." The word "this", we can
presume, is pointing right to what you had for lunch. And
yet it renders your answer incomplete, obliging me to wait
for you to say just what you mean by "this." But why?
Presumably because the word "this" merely points to your
lunch, without identifying it. But in that case, we might
expect the word "what" in my question to render it similarly
incomplete---if, that is, it referred to your lunch by
merely pointing to it, without identifying it. But the
question "What did you have for lunch?", I think we will
have to grant, is complete. And what makes it complete, it
seems, is the very word "what". For when I ask you what you
had for lunch, the question is only intelligible, and
answerable, if you *know*, and know at once, what I mean by
"what": namely, *what* you had for lunch. 

Yet this suggests that the word "what" in my question
somehow refers to what you had for lunch, not only without
identifying it, but even without pointing to it. In fact,
I think we could take this suggestion further, and say that
if my question about what you had for lunch is to *be*
a question, and make sense as a question, then the word
"what" must somehow refer to what you had, but as if there
were *nothing there* to be identified or pointed to. For if
I *could* identify what you had for lunch, or in any way
point to it, then it is hard to see how my doing so would
mean I was asking the question, rather than giving, or at
least starting, the answer. But in that case, we are driven
back to the puzzling sense in which the word "what" in my
question seems to refer to nothing---nothing to be
identified or pointed to, at least---in referring to what
you had for lunch.

(Find stuff to put up here.) 


Put the nothing that is something talk after the pronoun
bit. Broaden to other pronouns, and questions more
generally. How are questions not merely confessions or
exclamations of ignorance. How do they have enough
determinacy to be intelligible, and to suggest lines of
inquiry?   

If so, then we are driven back to the question
of how the word "what" is managing its reference. 
How do questions make reference to an answer, without being
an answer? 

Precision:  but not as if it were somewhere else, but as if
it were nowhere else. Nothing, rather than something. 

"I" doesn't identify because it refers, not to someone, but
to anyone and everyone. can refer to anyone, but it doesn't
point because in any use its reference is unambiguous. Use
why is there something rather than nothing to show how
reference can happen even when there is no answer. After
elaborate description, use the word "absence," but point out
that this misses what makes absence present. Nothing as if
it were something. Then generalize pronouns and questions,
before turning to personal pronouns, and pure indexicals.

Compare identification of "what" with identification in the
pronoun "you", or "I," or "today," or "here.". 


Bring up peculiarity of indexicals. They refer
exactly, but without fixing the reference.

Later point out how "I" fixes reference instantly, in any
context of use, but not by
pointing. Use this in why is there something rather than
nothing question. 


Later link pointing to ignorance, or absence: how is this
possible? Then move on to why is there something rather than
nothing. How can we point to absence?

(Note later that descriptions, not pointing, exclude sense
in which the description can be about me.) Link to
intelligibility. 

## Part One [one]

Once a week, from late August to early May, for the past
seventeen years, I have had to do something that I have
rarely found easy, never gotten better at, and only
sometimes done well.  The something I mean, as you may have
already guessed, is to find---or perhaps I say form---a good
opening question for seminar. If you asked me what makes an
opening question good, I'm not sure what I could say, or if
what I thought to say would agree with what someone else
might say. In my experience---and this is mostly an
experience of what my fellow-tutors have managed to do over
the years across the table from me---the better opening
questions tend to be brief, even pointed. Yet they also give
the impression, which may well work against pointed brevity,
of being whole-hearted rather than calculated. 

Still, the only sure sign of a good opening question that
I know, fails to appear until the question is asked.
And this sign bears close resemblance, I think, to a moment
of insight: where one says "a-ha!" or feels the key, as it
were, turn in the lock. As soon as the good opening question
is asked, it can somehow become a question for everyone else
in the room. Once you hear it, perhaps you think: "Why
didn't I think of that question?" Or perhaps you think:
"Yes, I had that question too, but didn't quite realize it
until now." Or perhaps you did realize it, but are struck
with how well the question is put, and how well it allows you
to appreciate the force of the question.  But in any case,
the good opening question indeed has a force. It makes a
kind of immediate sense. Or perhaps we could say it has
a kind of intrinsic intelligibility, in somehow providing
the conditions for its own recognition as a question. 

But it can seem a strange thing to say what I just said.
---To say, that is, that the good opening question---or
a good question more generally---has intrinsic
intelligibility. For suppose this intelligibility were
possessed by the book we were asking about, or more
generally by the world we were asking about. Suppose, in
other words, that what we were asking about made immediate
sense. In that case, it seems we would have nothing to ask
about. And while I compared the good opening
question to a moment of insight, we usually associate
insight with answers rather than questions; just as the
feeling of a key turning in the lock was taken by the
philosopher Charles Peirce, from whom I borrowed it, as
a sign of the successful explanation. Questions, then, are
a sign of We might even say that
if something is intelligible, and therefore somehow provides
the conditions for its own recognition, it is hard to see
not as a question, but rather as an answer to a question. 

o capture the sign of a successful explanation rather than
a good question.  from whom I borrowed the appeal to the
feeling of a key turning in the lock, was making this appeal
not to and when I appealed to the feeling of a key turning
in the lock, I borrowed the description from Charles Peirce,
who intended it to capture what it's like to explain
something well. when the philosopher Charles Pierce, , And
one might argue that being intelligible making immediate
sense is something thatone might say that making immediate
sense, or having intrinsic intelligibility, The book or
world would be intelligible enough to have answered all our
questionll our questions would be answered before they were
asked. we attributed intrinsic intelligibility to the book
we were asking about, or more generally to the world we were
asking about. It would seem a

Move on from here to describe peculiarity of this
intelligibility: for if things were simply intelligible
there would be no questions, so what is this
intelligibility? Also requires work to get to questions.
Also, one cannot be taught to ask such questions. 


There are  certainly more than one
way to explain why we do what we do at St. John's College,
and why we would call it education. And not just several
ways, I think, but contradictory ways, These ways, I think,
can even contradict one another, suggesting that we find
ourselves brought together by *what* we do, yet go our
separate ways in any reckoning of *why*. There is no doubt,
for example, that we have no departments at the college, no
majors, and no electives unless you count preceptorial. But
*why* this is so is not so easy to say. And what *I* might
say is not necessarily what a fellow tutor might say, or
what a student might say, or what the president of the
college might say. And there is no guarantee that what we
severally say will cohere. One of us might claim that we
have no departments or majors or electives, in order to
foster a community of learning. But then another of us might
reply that there is no such thing as a community of
learning, since learning can only be done on one's own; and
that the true reason for our lack of departments and majors
and electives lies not in a sense of community, but rather
in a conception of knowledge. But then the first of us might
rejoin that we can have no conception of knowledge without
knowledge, yet knowledge is just what we lack, in being what
we seek, not what we possess. 

What is the point of questions if they have no answers? and
what we seek, not what we possess. Indeed, our lack of such
divisions and specialities is sometimes There will be, to
borrow a term from Wittgenstein, there is no guarantee that

integrity than the kind of education we pursue here at St.
John's College, and more than one way to explain what makes
it education. Perhaps even ways that contradict one another,
suggesting that And perhaps even ways that contradict one
another. , and perhaps even ways that contradict one
another,   What makes a liberal education liberal? Perhaps
the simplest we could give

For the answer, I turn to an essay entitled
"The Idea of Liberal Education," written by Jacob Klein, a
former tutor and dean of St. John's College.  For in that
essay, Klein tries to address my opening question, I think,
in the most elementary way he can. Let me quote two passages
from the essay to show you what I mean. Here is the first
passage:


> The idea of liberal education, then, whether
you accept or reject it, is not definable in terms of some
peculiar subject matter. Some applied sciences may well fall
outside its scope. But, by and large, any formal discipline
may form its vehicle and basis. It is not the subject matter
that determines the character of studies as liberal
studies. It is rather in the way in which a formal
discipline, a subject matter, is taken up that is decisive:
whenever it is being studied for its own sake, whenever the
metastrophic way of questioning is upheld, whenever genuine
wonderment is present, liberal education is taking
place.[^Klein_Quote1]


And here is the second passage, which explains
what Klein means by the word "metastrophic": 

> I have said before that within
the confines of our horizon there is the expected as well as
the unexpected, the old and the new, the known and the
unknown, the familiar and the unfamiliar. We do, however,
experience a kind of question which, as it were, tends to
smash the bounds that limit us. We do occasionally stop
altogether and face the familiar as if for the first
time---anything: a person, a street, the sky, a fly. The
overwhelming impression on such occasions is the strangeness
of the thing we contemplate. This state of mind requires
detachment, and I am not at all certain to what extent we
can contrive its presence. We suddenly do not feel at home
in this world of ours. We take a deep look at things, at
people, at words, with eyes blind to the familiar. We
re-flect. Plato has a word for it: *metastrophê* or
*periagogê*, a turnabout, a conversion. We detach
ourselves from all that is familiar to us; we change the
direction of our inquiry; we do not explore the unknown
anymore; on the contrary, we convert the known into an
unknown. We wonder. And we burst out with that inexorable
question: Why is that so? To be sure, we have raised the
question "why" before. I can certainly ask: Why did it
snow yesterday and does not snow today? Why did Mr. X say
this or that to Mr. Y? But this "why" I am talking about
now is of a different kind. It does not lead to any
discovery or recovery. It calls myself into question with
all my questioning. It compels me to detach myself from
myself, to transcend the limits of my horizon; that is, it
educates me. It gives me the freedom to go to the roots of
all my questioning.[^Klein_Metastrophic]

Now, by calling these passages elementary, I
don't mean that they are perfectly clear. I'm not
even confident that all I'm about to say on their behalf is
what Klein actually meant. But what *is* clear, I
think, and this is what I take to be elementary about the
passages, is that Klein writes them in trying to capture
something about the essence of liberal education---or to
borrow his word for it, the *idea* of liberal
education---that lies beneath any particular book, or
subject, or curriculum, or institution, that we might
identify with liberal education. And there must be some such
idea, I think, for any such identification to be judged
correct, or true.

I also believe that Klein is essentially right in his
description of this idea---though again, I will later want
to say that his description actually leads to two ideas. But
for the moment I will call it one idea. Or as Klein again
calls it: *the* idea. And it does seem to me that
liberal education must have something to do, at bottom, with
a certain kind of questioning that involves our
conversion. Let me try to spell this out in my own way by
generalizing on Klein's example of a "why"
question. Suppose we were compelled to ask, not simply "Why
is *that* so?,"
but "Why is *anything* so?"  Why
is there something, in other words, rather than nothing?  It
is this question, I think, that provides a paradigm for the
kind of question Klein has in mind. For there is perhaps
nothing so familiar to us as the very presence of the world;
yet also nothing that can seem so strange, so accidental or
arbitrary.

And to question this presence is to call myself into
question in turn, insofar as I too am a part of this
presence, or something rather than nothing. Indeed, I
myself---and here I mean all of us insofar as we can each
say "I myself"---I myself am perhaps the most familiar
thing that I encounter in the world, yet I can also seem the
most strange, the most accidental or
arbitrary. For why do I exist? Or more exactly: why am I
this human being here, in front of you right now, existing
at this time and place rather than at some other time and
place, or even not at all? Or looking at my strangeness the
other way around: why is this human being *me* and no
one else?  Why is his point of view *my* point of view?

This question can be even more unsettling when we start to
wonder what the answer could be. Surely it would encompass
my own birth, and that of my parents, my grandparents, and
so on, back to some origin of the world as such. But would
the answer thereby encompass me?  It's easy to doubt it. It
can seem, in fact, as if the answer in this sense might
exhaustively explain my existence in the world,
yet without explaining---or even acknowledging---how
that existence is indeed *mine*, and no one else's. And
it can start to look as if the origin of my own point of
view upon the world, as indeed my own, escapes, or perhaps I
should say surpasses, all explanation.  But then the
question "Why is there something rather than nothing?"
would seem to have no answer, at least when directed
at me---when the question becomes: "Why am *I* something
rather than nothing?"

More unsettling still, it is through this same point of
view, this seemingly inexplicable point of view, that the
world gains its very presence. Leaving the source of its
existence aside, that is, we could say the source of
its presence lies in this point of view. For the world is
made present to me through the point of view upon it that I
share with no one else, just as it is made present to you
through the point of view upon it that you share with no one
else. But this means that the world becomes present, and in
this presence becomes questionable, through the very point
of view that seems to surpass all explanation. It can then
start to look as if the question "Why is there something
rather than nothing?" has no answer at all, even when
*not* directed at me. At the very least, the question
would surpass any answer that might be given to it, in
whatever way, if there is one, that I who ask the question
surpass any account that might be given of me. And leaving
aside whether there *is* an answer to this question, we
could say that the question itself is permanent rather than
provisional. Or as Klein puts it, the question doesn't lead
to any further discovery or recovery, insofar as there is
nothing to discover in the world, or to recover in myself,
that might dispense with the question once it is raised. 
The question reveals a difference for me, which no discovery
or recovery can entirely resolve, between the way that being
something rather than nothing is readily explained, and the
way that being something rather than nothing seems
inexplicable.

Now, Klein also says that such a question *educates*
me, giving me *the freedom* to go to the roots of all
my questioning. But it is tempting, I think, to draw just
the opposite conclusion from what I called the permanence of
the question. For wouldn't its permanence suggest that the
world is indeed accidental or arbitrary? And what
more could we learn from such a question in that case, about
either ourselves or the world, save that both exist as a
brute, inexplicable fact?  What more could we learn, in
other words, save that there is no freedom possible in such
a world, and thus no place for a liberal education. But this
is not Klein's conclusion, and I think that here too he is
right. Here is one way to think about why. The way I surpass
all explanation in this context is the way I *am free*
of all explanation---or more simply put, the way I am
free. Or to say this more exactly if elaborately: there is
no explaining the origin of my point of view upon the world,
insofar as it is mine alone, because in this respect, my
point of view *is* an origin, rather than having
one. Or let me say this again still more elaborately: my
point of view *as mine* is not an outcome of the world,
which might be explained in being traced back to an
origin; rather, it is an origin in itself. And a crucial
sign of this is indicated by Klein in what he calls the
roots of all my questioning. For because my point of view
*is* an origin, I am in a position not simply to
explain the world, or find answers in it, but to wonder
about the world, and ask questions of it. The reason that
the presence of the world can then be put into permanent
question, the reason we can wonder "Why is this
so?" of anything at all, is not because the world is
radically contingent, but rather because it is radically
originating. And the world is perhaps most essentially
originating, in a way that makes a place for liberal
education, in the very possibility of questions that are
permanent rather than provisional---which is to say,
questions we can ask of the world that remain questions even
when answered.

Let me try to spell all this out one last way before moving
on. There is, we can suppose, a way that the world is simply
there for us, or present to us. And this establishes what we
might call a horizon of acquaintance with things, within
which they are always already present, and in that sense
unquestionable. This is not to deny the existence of
questions within such a horizon, but rather to say that any
such question has some answer in front of it, that relies on
the very presence of what is being questioned. And because
of this presence, the answer can in effect supplant the
question, in what we might regard as the continual advance
in knowledge that we can make within this horizon, just
insofar as our questions about the world *have* answers.  We
could even identify this horizon, I think, with everything
there is to *learn* about the world. And if this were the
only horizon available to us, liberal education would be, in
a literal sense of the word, *mathematical*, where we learn
the things that *can* be learned.

But this is not, it turns out, the only horizon available to
us. And this changes---or converts---the idea of liberal
education radically, from having a mathematical orientation
to having a philosophical one. For the very presence of the
world, again, can become utterly strange, where we wonder
*why* it is there for us, and what gives it the very
presence it has, the very presence that establishes our
horizon of acquaintance. This experience of strangeness and
wonder is only possible, I think, where there is a larger
horizon available to us---if "horizon" is still the
word---that encompasses our horizon of acquaintance. And
within this larger horizon, we could say that things are
inherently questionable, which is to say, that things are
present to us only insofar as they are questionable. This is
not to deny the existence of answers within such a horizon,
but rather to say that any such answer has some question
behind it, that relies on the very questionability of what
is present. And because of this questionability, the answer
is prevented from supplanting the question. What the answer
does instead, we could say, is address the question. And
within this horizon, then, there is no advance, in the usual
sense, in our knowledge of things, but rather a deepening of
it. We might think of this deepening as a continual
clarification, within this horizon, of why, and to what
extent, our knowledge of things *is* knowledge. And this
clarification is possible just insofar as our answers have
questions about the world behind them, to which they *are*
the answers. We could even identify this horizon, I think,
with everything there is to *wonder* about the world, or
*ask* about the world, that makes us learn, in making us
want to learn, and in that way able to learn. And since this
is a second horizon available to us that encompasses the
first, liberal education is no longer mathematical, but
again philosophical, where we might say, if paradoxically,
that we learn the things that *can't* be learned.

That such things can't be learned is acknowledged by Klein,
I think, when he mentions that he is not at all certain to
what extent we can contrive the presence of the state of
mind that allows us to wonder. Indeed, Klein's further
description makes it seem as if this state of mind comes
largely unbidden: suddenly rather than deliberately. And
this should be no surprise, I think, if this state of mind
finally reflects the way, at such moments of wonder about
the world, we are indeed an origin rather than an outcome of
the world, or free rather than determined. But if this means
that the wonder at the heart of liberal education cannot be
contrived, then any curriculum of liberal education becomes
puzzling. For what is the curriculum for? This is a second
question that seems to have followed from the answer to my
first. For the way we are freed through liberal education,
at least on the answer I have just discussed, is through the
detached state of mind that allows us to wonder about the
world. Yet there nothing, let us suppose, that can compel
that state of mind. But if so, then again, what is a
curriculum of liberal education for? Why does it exist?

[Back to top][top]

##  Part Two [two]

For one answer to this question, I can turn to
another essay by Klein on liberal education, this one simply
entitled "On Liberal Education." And again Klein tries to
answer this question in an elementary way. Here is one
passage to show you what I mean:

> Let me talk, then, about such a
program. It has first of all to select the material which
would compel the learner to reflect and to get rid of the
sediments in his thinking so as to enable him to reach the
level of intellectual clarity. This material is available in
the great documents of human seeing, hearing, imagining, and
understanding, that is to say, in the Old Testament, in the
works of Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Plato,
Aristotle, in the New Testament, in Augustine, Thomas
Aquinas, Dante, Francis Bacon, Shakespeare, Galileo,
Descartes, Newton, Locke, Hume, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel,
Darwin, the great novelists of the nineteenth century,
Nietzsche, Freud, Whitehead and many others. The task is to
read these works, which contain our intellectual
heritage---which, in turn, is permeated by vagueness and
sedimentation---in such a way as to re-awaken the insights
in which they are rooted and to reflect on these insights
and their ultimate assumptions. This task is tremendous; at
best, only a beginning can be made.[^Klein_Quote3]

Here is how I understand this passage, in light
of my earlier discussion. On the one hand, there is nothing
sufficient, of itself, to produce the state of mind
that allows us to wonder about the world. On the other hand,
there is something necessary to produce it. For it
turns out that our horizon of acquaintance with things is
not something we possess; it is rather something we inhabit.
Or even more exactly, it is something we are embedded
in. Klein's way of putting this, indebted to Husserl, is
that our thinking about things is, in the first place,
*sedimented*.[^Husserl]

Leaving the details of Husserl's
complicated account for this aside, I think we can see the
possibility of this predicament in the way I earlier
described our horizon of acquaintance with things. For this
is again the horizon within which things are unquestionable,
in being always already present. Things thus go unquestioned
within this horizon, in most cases simply, but in other
cases, again, by answers that supplant the questions that
led to them. But now consider another way of putting this
last point. Let us say that the answers *cover up* the
questions that led to them. If this were true, then moving
beyond this horizon, and back to the questions behind those
answers, would seem impossible in any immediate way. For we
would first have to uncover what has been covered up. Or as
Klein puts it, we would first have to rid ourselves of the
sediments in our thinking, and in that sense work at
*clarifying* our minds. But this, then, is one answer
to my second question, of what a curriculum of liberal
education is for, or why it exists. It exists to free us
from our embeddedness in one horizon so that we
might reach the other horizon, even if there is no
guarantee that we will.

Now, in discussing this answer, I have made no mention yet
of great books, or what Klein calls those great documents of
human seeing, hearing, imagining, and understanding that
contain our intellectual heritage. But to say they contain
this heritage is already to suggest how they become central
to a curriculum of liberal education, so understood. For
this is to say, I think, that these books have established
the very horizon that we find ourselves embedded in, even as
they themselves become embedded in that horizon, under
layers of scholarship and commentary. To free
ourselves from our own embeddedness thus
becomes a matter of freeing these books from their
embeddedness. And this means reading them in such a way, as
Klein says, as to reawaken the insights in which they are
rooted.

But what could Klein mean by this?  For the moment,
I think we can safely infer that he means, at the very
least, that great books will have to be read carefully. For
reading them in a cursory way would seem to risk, if not
ensure, that we will read them only from within the very
horizon we are trying to escape. And this, then, tells us
not simply what a curriculum of education is for, but how it
works---in what I will now call *one* idea of liberal
education. For in essence, the curriculum works through the
careful reading of certain great books. And everything else
that might be found in this curriculum---the study
of language, the activity of conversation---would be for
the sake of that end. The curriculum would exist as a whole
to help us read such books as best we can.

It is no surprise, in any case, to find this view of reading
attributed to Klein by the former tutor J.  Winfree Smith,
in his history of the St.  John's Program. "Klein," he
writes, "thought an absorbing preoccupation with the
content of a great book to be a necessary condition for
learning."[^Winfree_Quote1] But
what is surprising, I think, is the context of
this remark. For it is made to contrast Klein's view with
that of Scott Buchanan, who with Stringfellow Barr founded
the very program at St.  John's where great books are
read. "Buchanan," writes Smith, "was content if a student
acquired only a superficial acquaintance with the content
[of a great book], provided that it were sufficiently
suggestive and provocative of thought; if the thought moved
far away from the book, that was no matter for
concern."[^Winfree_Quote2]
More surprising still is an earlier passage in Smith's book,
again about Buchanan.  For there Smith offers a mixed
assessment of Buchanan's way of thinking---or as he calls
it, Buchanan's way of philosophizing---which evidently aimed
at producing unities out of diversities, yet for that reason
led Buchanan to make what Smith calls "simple blunders" in
a "cavalier" reading of great books.[^Winfree_Quote3]
Yet Smith goes on to
suggests a link between Buchanan's careless way with great
books and the very character of the St.  John's Program:

> What has been said about Buchanan's way of
philosophizing should be of help in understanding what his
conception of the program was, why with all its emphasis on
tradition it was not in any way committed to the past as
past or to the thought of any particular thinker, why it was
as ambitious as it was, and why it might be called
philosophical in a large sense. Just as Buchanan himself was
not particularly concerned to discover an author's meaning,
neither was he particularly concerned that that should be
the aim of the students. He expected them to get from their
readings some thoughts, some insights, some questions which,
though they might even spring from a serious misreading,
would spark discussion and result in whatever the free
intellect might learn.[^Winfree_Quote4]

Now, this passage about Buchanan, I think, is
where we find a second idea of liberal education opposed to
the first idea. For let us again ask the questions: What is
a curriculum of liberal education for? And how does it work?
Under the first idea of how it works, we have to read great
books carefully, but under the second idea, we can read them
carelessly. And this goes hand-in-hand with contradictory
answers to the question of what the curriculum is for, which
is implicit in Smith's striking description of the intellect
in the passage above: as something already free and ready to
learn. For this suggests that under the second idea, the
curriculum does *not* exist to free us from our
embeddedness in the horizon of acquaintance. For we are not
embedded there, even at the start. Instead, because of our
intellect, which again is already free and ready to learn,
we are located in the other horizon, and can wonder about
the world from where we stand. And since our access to this
horizon is therefore immediate, there is no need for a
careful reading of great books to get us there.

But why, then, *does* the curriculum exist, under this
second idea? What *is* the curriculum for? I think we
can understand this by considering Buchanan's own way
of affirming the freedom of intellect. Consider, for
example, a famous address he once gave in 1958, entitled
"The Last Don Rag."  Here is a sampling of the questions
Buchanan imagined asking the students of St.  John's College
at their last don rag : "Do you believe in and trust your
intellect, that innate power that never sleeps?"  "Do you
recognize the action of this power as you live and learn?"
"Have you, in the course of your life, before, after, or
while you were at St.  John's, become your own teacher?"
"Have you yet recognized that you are and always have been
your own teacher?"[^Buchanan_Quote1]

Now, one reason that would-be students at this don rag, in
hearing that last question, might answer "no", is because they
went to the college where great books are the teachers. So,
at any rate, goes a famous slogan of the college, which was
popular in Buchanan's day.[^Winfree_Quote5] But I think the two sources of
teaching could be regarded as one and the same, under this
second idea of liberal education. Since the intellect on
this view is again already free, and our access to the
horizon of questioning immediate, our relation to great
books is not, fundamentally, that of a reader, but rather
that of a writer. This is just another way of saying, at
least on this idea, that our point of view upon the world is
an origin rather than an outcome. Insofar as our point of
view is individually ours alone, we possess the point of
view of an author. And the careless way we might read a
great book bears less resemblance, in its indifference, to
what we would find in superficial summaries of that book,
and more resemblance to what we might find in the book
itself, when its author speaks of past great books in a
cursory and even dismissive manner, as a way of starting
from scratch. So this way of thinking about the second idea,
I think, leads to the following positive answer of what a
curriculum of liberal education is for, and a fuller answer
of how it works. We encounter great books not as artifacts
of thought to be studied, but rather as models of thought to
be imitated. And the point of imitating them is not to
clarify our minds, but rather to cultivate them. So the
curriculum, under this idea, is where the reading of great
books is only one exercise, even if the central exercise,
among the many that develop the intellect.  The study of
language would have a place, as would the activity of
conversation. But these would now, in a sense, be for their
own sake, or at least for the sake of the intellect's
self-assertion, and perhaps its self-knowledge, in coming to
know that it is indeed always free and never asleep. Or to
put the contrast of this second idea with the first idea one
final way: the curriculum as a whole would exist as if to
help us write great books as best we can, read them as we
will.

Now, there are two more ways we might contrast these two
ideas of liberal education that I find interesting, and
mention them for what they might be worth as a way of
concluding my lecture. The first way brings me back to the
question of what Klein could mean when he says that we have
to read great books in such a way as to reawaken the
insights in which they are rooted. Now earlier, I inferred
from this only that we have to read great books
carefully. But Klein says more than this, and does so, I
think, to distinguish a merely careful reading from a truly
thoughtful one, which in this context means distinguishing
the kind of careful reading that simply adds another layer
of scholarship and commentary on top of the book in
question, from the kind of careful reading that digs through
these layers, and reaches the book itself. But even that is
not quite what Klein says. Or rather, he says more.  For the
book itself, in his description, is rooted in certain
insights. And the insights, in turn, are to be re-awakened
by the reading. But this suggests that the reading is
accomplished, finally, insofar as we have rid ourselves of a
kind of sleep in our thinking, rather than a kind of
sediment. Or as Buchanan might well have put it, the reading
is accomplished, finally, insofar as the intellect in us,
being always free and never asleep, is applied to the book,
allowing us to re-awaken its insights rather than merely
recollect them. Or more simply put, but again on Buchanan's
behalf: the reading is accomplished when we can read the
book as if we were writing the book. In any case, I think
we can see a possible difference here between the two ideas
on the very character of thought. For under the one idea,
where sedimentation is the difficulty, thinking would be a
kind of transparency; while under the other idea, where
somnolence might be thought the difficulty, thinking would
be a kind of wakefulness.

The second way we might contrast the ideas turns me briefly,
and finally, to another difference between Klein and
Buchanan noted by Winfree Smith in his history of the St. 
John's Program, when he tells of how Klein became dean at
the college in 1949, and was now in charge of the curriculum
established by Buchanan: "Convinced as he was of the
fundamental rightness of that curriculum he [Klein] was not
about to make any revolutionary changes. Precisely in that
respect he was unlike Buchanan who, as [Mortimer] Adler once
said, thought that whatever had become established must have
something wrong with it and who in 1943 had reported
approvingly to his son Douglas the remark of a young faculty
member that 'almost everything has to be rebuilt if we are
to go on'."[^Winfree_Quote6] In a related vein,
Buchanan himself once remarked to Smith, years after leaving
the college, that he and Stringfellow Barr never believed
they had founded the program they were credited with, and
even seemed to suggest that the program's survival in its
original form was a sign of failure rather than
success. "They thought of themselves," so Smith reports,
"not as having found, but as being in search of a liberal
arts college. He [Buchanan] seemed to have got the
impression that we at St.  John's, without having found, had
stopped seeking."[^Winfree_Quote7]
It
looks from this as if what Klein took as his duty to
conserve, Buchanan would have taken as his duty to destroy,
and then rebuild. This difference too is explained, I think,
by what I have called two ideas of liberal education. We
might say that the college, in this case, is like a great
book itself, which under one idea can be contemplated as if
it were already written and ready to be read, yet under the
other idea can be contemplated as if the writing were still
to be done.  We might well ask under which of these ideas
our college is best understood.

## Coda [coda]

In the question period of this lecture there
was one question, asked in various forms by several tutors,
that I thought worth briefly addressing in a "coda" to
this lecture. One way to put the question (and thanks to
Harvey Flaumenhaft and John Verdi for their particular
formulations of this) would be as follows: is there anything
in the Buchanan idea of liberal education, as I accounted
for it in my lecture, that would *require* the reading
of great books? Is there anything in that idea, in fact,
that would require *any* reading of
*any* books?
Another way to put the question (thanks to Anita Kronsberg
for her formulation of this) would be: what is it about
great books that Buchanan found so important as to give them
a central place in the program at St.  John's, or more
generally in a curriculum of liberal education?

One way to address this question, I think, would be through
what Klein and Buchanan *did* agree about, in their
understanding of the program. Smith describes this agreement
as follows:

>Klein certainly to a very large extent
shared the opinions on which the St.  John's program as
Buchanan had envisaged it had been based; that the end of
liberal education is the intellectual virtues and that the
best way to develop and to cultivate the intellectual
virtues is through intensive acquaintance with the whole
intellectual tradition of the Western World and through the
liberal arts.[^Winfree_Quote8]

Just from this passage, we could say, on behalf
of either idea of liberal education discussed above, that an
encounter with great books has a central place in liberal
education, insofar as it provides the intensive acquaintance
with our intellectual tradition that helps to develop and
cultivate the intellectual virtues.

Buchanan's own way of putting this point, which includes
explicit reference to great books (or what Buchanan here
calls "the classics"), can be found in the first catalog
for the New Program that Buchanan wrote in 1937:

>  It is the purpose of the new program at St. John's College
  to recover the great liberal tradition of Europe and
  America, which for a period of two thousand years has kept
  watch over and guided all the other Occidental
  traditions. All liberal colleges ought to be devoted
  servants of this great tradition, and this is the secret
  of their tenacious attempts to discharge their functions
  against many odds.
  
> The tangible and eminently available embodiments and tools
of this great tradition are the classics and the liberal
arts.
 
But while this passage otherwise encompasses the agreement
between Buchanan and Klein described by Smith, there are two
formulations in the passage that I suspect distinguish
Buchanan's view from Klein's. First, Buchanan says that the
purpose of the new program is to *recover*---where I
imagine Klein might prefer to say *recollect*---the
tradition in question. Second, Buchanan says that liberal
colleges ought to *serve*---where Klein might prefer to
say *study*---this tradition. The reason for these
differences, I think, has to do with the role of
sedimentation in Klein's understanding of this tradition,
along with a related and radical difference between ancient and
modern thought, neither of which seems to have informed
Buchanan's conception of the tradition, at least
originally. Smith notes, for example, that in 
the original 1937 catalogue statement, no mention is made of
the Cartesian revolution, yet this becomes explicit 
in the very next statement of
1938--39, which Smith speculates is from Klein's influence
upon his arrival in 1938: "It may be that the emphasis on
the Cartesian revolution had resulted from conversation
between Buchanan and Klein who was particularly insistent on
the revolutionary consequences for all modern thought of
Descartes' way of thinking."[^Winfree_Quote9]

In any case, the way I might capture this difference in
light of my discussion above as as follows. Under both ideas
of liberal education, great books establish our horizon of
acquaintance with things. But under one idea, which we could
identify with Klein, *this founding has already
happened*, and needs to be recollected, demanding a
particular sort of encounter with great books, which I
characterized as "careful" reading above.  But under the
other idea, which we could identify with Buchanan,
*this founding can happen again*, and needs to be
recovered, demanding a particular but different sort of
encounter with great books, which I characterized as
"careless" reading above, or more positively, as the kind
of reading performed by the would-be writer of a great book
rather than by the would-be reader of one.

But repeating this point about reading allows me to conclude
this coda with what may be a more compelling way than I
offered in the lecture of thinking about the difference
between careful and careless readings of great books. We
could think of this as the difference between a reading that
is principally *interpretive* and a reading that is
principally *imaginative*. And on the interpretive
reading as I envision it, we would read, say, Leibniz's
*Monadology* to address a question like "What did
Leibniz mean by 'monad'?", striving in this way to gain
clarity or comprehension about a concept or idea that has
indeed already informed our understanding of things, however
implicitly or unknowingly. But on the imaginative reading as
I envision it, we would read Leibniz's *Monadology*
rather to address a question like "What about the world
makes Leibniz's use of `monad' meaningful?", striving in
this way to gain through the book an actual perception of
the world that can now, and perhaps forevermore, inform our
understanding of things. Or to put this difference one final
way, in the interpretive reading questions of meaning are
prior to questions of being, since on this idea we are
*inheritors* of a horizon of acquaintance through the
book in question; while in the imaginative reading questions
of being are prior to questions of meaning, since on this
idea we are *benefactors* of a horizon of acquaintance
through the book in question.

## Introduction {#intro}

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal
Art," is meant to express a worry I have about the future of
liberal education. This puts me in a sizable club. To have
worries at all has become reflexive among those
of us in any way devoted to this education. And there is no
end these days, it seems, to prophecies, even
pronouncements, of death. Type the words "death of liberal
education" into Google, and you get back such headlines as

> [Why Liberal Arts Education is Dying (or Already Dead)](http://www.aleteia.org/en/education/documents/why-liberal-arts-education-is-dying-or-already-dead-228015)

> [The Liberal Arts Major: Would you like fries with that?](http://collegeadmissionbook.com/blog/liberal-arts-major-would-you-fries)   

All these headlines, I think, have one thing in common.
While they may disagree about the threat to liberal
education, they agree in distinguishing liberal education
from the threat, as if the threat were external. The
headlines make you think something *else* is killing liberal
education, whether it be liberals or conservatives or
technology or the economy. And it is hard to envision
a defense of liberal education without such a distinction,
even if headlines draw it simplistically, or even
inaccurately. For if liberal education itself were somehow
the threat, then death might well be liberal education's
best defense, but in defeat. No surprise, then, that those
of us devoted to liberal education are wont to conceive its
threats as if they came from outside it. For this justifies
a defense that succeeds only if liberal education survives.

And there is no shortage of such defenses. Type the words
"defense of liberal education" into Google, and you will
find one, it seems, for every headline predicting the death
of liberal education. And not just in articles. There are
books to defend liberal education, most recently [a
bestseller](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-04-19/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html)
by Fareed Zakaria, bearing the title [*In Defense of
a Liberal
Education*](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/In-Defense-of-a-Liberal-Education/).[^books]
There are blogs to defend liberal education, including [one
at St. John's](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/)
featuring regular posts by Christopher Nelson, the Annapolis
president.[^blogs] <!--Perhaps mention that you'll be quoting from
this in what follows.--> There are campaigns to defend liberal
education, with slogans like *Securing America's Future: The
Power of Liberal Arts Education,* to mention just [one
initiative](http://www.cic.edu/Research-and-Data/Liberal-Arts/Campaign/Pages/default.aspx),
launched in 2012 by the Council of Independent
Colleges.[^campaigns] And behind these campaigns are
associations to defend liberal education, like the
just-mentioned [Council of Independent
Colleges](http://www.cic.edu/About-CIC/Pages/default.aspx),
or the [Association of American Colleges and
Universities](https://www.aacu.org/about), or the
[Association for General and Liberal
Studies](http://www.agls.org/AboutUs.htm), or the
[Association for Core Texts and
Courses](http://www.coretexts.org/), or the [American
Academy for Liberal
Education](http://www.aale.org/index.php/about-aale/mission).
There are so many defenders of liberal education, in fact,
that you can even find
[think-pieces](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/19/liberal-arts-colleges-rethink-their-messaging-face-criticism)
pondering why they seem to have failed, since liberal
education remains in peril.

But what if the defenders have succeeded---by putting
liberal education in peril? What if the threat to liberal
education comes from within? This is my worry. Let the idea
of a liberal art, for the moment, simply mean whatever it is
that distinguishes a liberal education from any other form
of education---a technical education, say. What if our many
defenses of liberal education have made us forget this idea?
What if the idea of a liberal art is lost?

## Part One {#one}

Now in one sense, I think, the threat to liberal education
must always come from within. The fate of liberal education,
after all, will not be decided in headlines, but in
choices made by each of us about the best education, once
education matters. Not the best education, then, in general,
as such, *per se*; but the best education for my daughter,
or my son, or me. In having to make such choices, those
devoted to liberal education are no different from those
dismissive of it.  And in this respect, the threat to
liberal education can never lie outside it. To pursue an
education at all, liberal or no, is to have answered
a question that a liberal education obliges each of us to
ask, and ask on our own behalf: What does it mean to be
educated? And we might well answer this question in a choice
*against* liberal education, even at the risk of its
extinction, if the same choice is made repeatedly. But this
is perhaps the best evidence we have that the question is
real, and the threat to liberal education therefore
intrinsic to it. The death of liberal education, so
understood, would similarly come from within, in a proof of
its life, and perhaps the only proof of life.

But again, those of us devoted to liberal education are
unlikely to want this death, especially just to show we were
devoted to something rather than nothing. And while the
threat may be internal in this general sense, it is still
external, I think, in a specific sense.
For if the threat to liberal education does come from
within, in a question it would have us ask for ourselves
about what it means to be educated, then while we may well
answer this question in a choice against liberal education,
we may also answer the question otherwise, by choosing
liberal education. Liberal education would then be a second
answer to the question, opposed to the first. And insofar as
one answer opposes the other, the threat to liberal
education would be external. 

But if the threat *is* external, as one answer opposed to
another, then we can infer at least one thing, I think, about any
defense of liberal education against this threat. It will
have to convince us that liberal education *does* provide an
answer, even for those who give a different answer. It will
have to show us that something is lost in a choice against
liberal education, whatever might be gained; and that the
answer we give in such a choice, even if it turns out right,
risks being wrong. And showing this much, it seems, means
showing there is something learned in liberal education,
that would otherwise go unlearned. To show, in short, that
liberal education has a subject-matter. Or, in a word:
content. <!--Later, give more simple description of problem:
that not having content means not being an answer to the
question.-->

But what, then, *is* this content? What should we say is
learned in a liberal education alone? Traditionally, the
content of a liberal education was identified with
a curriculum of seven liberal arts, a so-called *trivium* of
grammar, logic, and rhetoric; and a *quadrivium* of
arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Each of these
arts was thought to wed a skill to a subject. And
together, these arts were thought to form a whole. This is
why one could say there was *something* to learn in
a liberal education, rather than many things, or anything,
or nothing. This is also what I want to say is contained in
the idea of a liberal art: a skill wedded to a subject, in
a whole of such skills and subjects, that gives a liberal
education its content. 

But one might also suspect that a liberal education has no
content in this sense, and that the liberal arts as
traditionally conceived show us why. They were learned,
after all, by the few rather than the many---the leisured
few, in that sense already free from servitude. Perhaps the
education they received was 'liberal,' then, not in
liberating them, but in shaping them, stamping them, and
perpetuating them. And the same might be suspected of any
content. For in what sense could we be freed by it, rather
than bound to it? What distinguishes content, so-called,
from dogma, or doctrine? What keeps it from closing the mind
that a truly liberal education is meant to open? 

This suspicion of content can also come from the opposite
direction, so to speak: by what we take to threaten liberal
education, or indeed any form of education. For leaving
headlines aside, this threat can seem to reflect a kind of
triumph of content over context, from college rankings and
scorecards at the start, to tests and grades at the end,
making the very meaning of education a matter of data-driven
results; and a choice against liberal education the answer
to a question never asked. Or we might conceive this threat
in economic terms, reducing education to just another
a product with a price in the global marketplace. Against
all this, the first thing we might think to say in defense
of education is that products are not enough, results are
not enough, answers are not enough, content is not enough. 

Defenses of liberal education, accordingly, have generally
made education a matter of context rather than content. And
the most common way of doing this is to locate learning not
in a set of subjects, but instead in the self. Thus [it is
said that](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/12/11/looking-value-college-wrong/) "the maturation of the student---not information
transfer---is the real purpose of colleges and
universities." [Or that](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/joannecreighton/article_liberal99) "if we are to
navigate skillfully the turbulent changes of the
twenty-first century, we must educate students not only to
process information effectively, but to think wisely and
well."

And talk of turbulent changes points to another way that
defenses of liberal education have made it a matter of
context: by locating the self in an ever-changing world.
[A good 
example](http://www.sjc.edu/files/8013/9593/4530/league-of-women-voters-2011.pdf)
comes from an address by President Nelson: 

> With boundaries among the disciplines vanishing, with job
requirements and needs changing rapidly, we need citizens
prepared for change, prepared to adapt to jobs that do not
yet exist, prepared to enter an unknown world with a kind of
fearless determination to undertake whatever is required to
succeed. We will need skills of inquiry to enter a world we
cannot yet even envision.

We can begin to see from this quote why making liberal
education a matter of context rather than content, means
forgetting, more or less deliberately,  the idea of
a liberal art. For suppose we did live in a world that
changes more than it abides, where our freedom, to the
extent this depended on skill, were a matter of adaptation
more than application. <!--Later correct this as a world
that doesn't change, because the truth doesn't change.-->
Any art that deserved the name 'liberal', in that case,
would involve a skill more likely divorced from any subject
than wedded to one; which is to say, a skill that can be
applied to many subjects, even to every subject. And suppose
the number of such subjects to have multiplied past
counting, in one way the world indeed seems to have changed,
since the advent of modern science. <!--Perhaps allude to
this later. Modern science produces diversity; ancient
science a totality.--> If the liberal arts could still be
said to encompass a set of subjects, then it would seem
better understood as a diversity than as a totality.   

So once defenses of liberal education make it a matter of
context, it is unsurprising that they separate its skills
from its subjects.  The subjects, if they are specified at
all, are specified to give an impression of breadth, as if
there were many things one might learn in a liberal
education rather than just one. The current St. John's
website, for example,
[speaks](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts)
of the college's "wide-ranging, interdisciplinary
curriculum," where "areas of study include philosophy,
literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and
languages." Other lists of subjects are even more expansive.
One from the earlier-mentioned *Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign [makes it
sound](http://www.liberalartspower.org/lowdown/what/Pages/default.aspx)
as if you might study anything:  

> You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors
that are included in the liberal arts. They include much
more than studio art and English classes (though those are
great!)---they range from mathematics to Mandarin, from
statistics to sociology. At liberal arts colleges and
universities students can study the sciences---such as
biology, chemistry, and physics---and social
sciences---including economics, political science, and
psychology. Students can study newer subjects, such as
environmental science and neuroscience, and traditional
ones, too.

This same impression of breadth is given in the way defenses
of liberal education present its skills apart from subjects.
You can indeed learn anything, then, in learning *how* to
learn. And this encompasses a range of skills similarly
presented apart from subjects: how to read, how to write,
how to speak, even how to think.[^ZakariaEarthly] St. John's
current way of putting this is [to
claim](<http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/>) that its
students "learn to speak articulately, read attentively,
reason effectively, and think creatively."

[^ZakariaEarthly]: A good example of this is found in Fareed Zakaria, ["What is
the Earthly Use of Liberal
Education."](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fareed-zakaria/fareed-zakaria-liberal-arts-education_b_5380896.html)

In a similar vein, defenses of liberal education will call
the liberal arts "transferable skills," [^transferable],
again against the backdrop of an ever-changing job market.
And "usefulness" has become a ubiquitous word to counter
the opinion, and the traditional conviction, that the
liberal arts are useless. <!--Bring "useless" back up
later, and give a defense of it--> It is more generally the
habit in defenses of liberal education to talk of the
liberal arts as if they empowered us rather than enlightened
us---the aforementioned [*Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign](http://www.liberalartspower.org/Pages/default.aspx)
being the most explicit example.

[^Linker]: "How can liberal education be saved? By becoming truly, enduringly
useful." <>

[^transferable]: "Although modern liberal arts curriculums have an updated
choice of a larger range of subjects, it still retains the
core aims of the liberal arts curricula maintained by the
medieval universities: to develop well-rounded individuals
with general knowledge of a wide range of subjects and with
mastery of a range of transferable skills. They will become
‘global citizens’, with the capacity to pursue lifelong
learning and become valuable members of their communities."
<http://www.topuniversities.com/blog/what-liberal-arts-education>

There are deeper strains in this line of defense, that
try to reach beyond a liberal education's usefulness for any
career, to the way it might be useful for life, making the
self, in sense, the subject of its skills. A liberal arts
education can be "truly, enduringly useful," so [one
recent 
defense puts
it](http://theweek.com/articles/559681/how-save-liberal-arts-education),
once it is "oriented
towards the question of how to live." Or as President Nelson [has
written](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2015/02/26/hiring-grads-whats-going-part-iv/): 

> The primary purpose of college---contrary to the opinion of
> hiring managers---is not to provide trained-up workers for
> business, nor even to provide young people with the skills
> needed to make a living. The primary purpose is to help
> young people develop the character and the judgment to
> shape a life worth living.

In these appeals to the way a life might be shaped, defenses
of liberal education might be said to deepen the sense in
which liberal education is a matter of context, not content,
by locating what is learned in a cultivated readiness for
the world, whatever the world may hold. Here is how a recent
St. John's graduate puts it: 

> After my two-year commitment with Teach For America,
I hope to continue my work in the field of education. But
really, I can do anything. St. John’s has given me the
tools: the ability to listen, to think, to speak, to write,
and ultimately, to act. I need only to decide where to
direct my passion, and the world is mine, thanks to the
incredible education I have had the blessing to receive
here. [^Tyson]

[^Tyson]: This comes from Grace Tyson, ["'When You Know Better, You Do Better': A Senior's Reflections on St. John's](http://www.thejohnniechair.com/when-you-know-better-you-do-better-a-seniors-reflections-on-st-johns/). Parts of this address are also quoted in Christopher Nelson, [Is It Worth It?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-nelson/is-it-worth-it_1_b_3321206.html).

And there are ways to deepen this context still further; the
most common being to take this readiness for the world as an
openness to the world, whether the self so opened is
described as curious, inquisitive, imaginative,
self-critical, or sympathetic. Thus we find Martha Nussbaum,
to pick on a famous example, [defending liberal
education](http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0709s.pdf)
insofar as it develops

1. The capacity for Socratic
self-criticism and critical thought about one's own traditions.
2. The ability to see oneself as a member of a heterogeneous nation
and world.
3. The ability to sympathetically imagine the lives of people different
from oneself.

And as suggested by Nussbaum's reference to Socrates, the
sense in which a truly liberal education opens minds rather
than closes them has particular appeal at St. John's, where
it would now sound antiquated to claim, as Scott Buchanan
did in the first catalog of the New Program, that the
liberal arts put us in possession of the truth.[^Buchanan]
What we say instead is self-consciously Socratic. Thus President 
Nelson [will say that](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/10/20/knowing-learn/) "liberal education is the best and
quickest way to become comfortable not
knowing." [Or that](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/11/10/accountability-commodifying-examined-life/) "learning is grounded in recognition and
acceptance of one’s own ignorance."
Or as the same St. John's
graduate I quoted earlier puts it: 

> I have learned that great questions lead to more and more
questions, not necessarily to answers, and I have learned
that the greatness of the human spirit shows itself in just
this realization. As Socrates says in Plato’s *Meno*: “We
shall be better and braver and less helpless if we think
that we ought to enquire, than we should have been if we
indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no
use in seeking to know what we do not know.” We must have
intellectual bravery, that is, the courage to push forward,
to continue seeking truth even in the face of doubts about
its very existence.

[^Buchanan]: "The arts of apprehending, understanding, and knowing the
truth are the liberal arts, and they set their own ends."
(*Bulletin of St. John's College in Annapolis, 1937--38*).

It is this same Socratic self-consciousness that explains
how St. John's can make even an all-required program of
books, which might thought inescapably full of content, into
a matter of context. For anything written down, we might
claim, is simply doctrine, until a reader puts it into
dialogue by questioning it rather than assimilating it. And
underlying this shift from doctrine to dialogue is perhaps
the deepest belief one can have about a truly liberal
education: that we are only able to learn, truly learn,
insofar as we do this for ourselves. It would seem to follow
directly from this that *what* we learn is found indeed in
the self, or even the soul, rather than in a set of
subjects. And the more liberal an education becomes, so we
could say, the more that *what* we learn is a matter of
*how* we learn, and *who* we become in learning it. Which at
this college, at least, means the more that any so-called
subject is found in a book, which is found in a reader of
that book, who is found in a conversation about that book,
which brings the book to life, with all it may contain. And
this conversation, both with others and with oneself, might
then be said to exemplify the sense in which a liberal
education is ultimately a matter of context rather than
content. For this is an education in selfhood rather than
subjects, where the something we finally learn is what it
means to learn, and even what it means to love it.   

The suspicion that a truly liberal education has no content,
then, can be cast in terms that encompass what many of us,
I think, might say a liberal education finally is, and where
any appeal to a number of liberal arts seems beside the
point. St. John's even tried dropping any reference to the
liberal arts, along with any mention of liberal education,
when it first launched its new website, as if indeed to
forget the whole idea. But it did this, I think, to locate
the place of a liberal education in the present rather than
the past. It was only a matter of months before the college
restored these references to its website, since there were
prospective students still using such terms to find such
things. But St. John's has otherwise remained embarked, like
nearly every other liberal arts college in the country,
on a communications project carried out in images rather
than text, in the attempt not simply to say what a liberal
education is, but to show it, and capture something about
the *experience* of a liberal education when mere
explanations are thought no longer enough. Gone are the days
when the college could package its education, as it were, in
a brown paper wrapper, as if the education were not only
a matter of content, but the kind of content that couldn't
be seen from outside. Even the first video St. John's made
of itself, back in 1954, was mostly staged and performed
in vignettes, retaining at least that much separation from
the ongoing world. But it is just this separation that is
now deemed better erased than preserved, leading to efforts
that range from the Summer Academy to the college's
Instagram feed, as if to give the impression that what
separates the college from the outside world is only
a window, and a window more often open than shut. At its
worst, this project might be said to pander or flatter
rather than inform or educate; but at its best, it might be
said to make St. John's finally look like a college rather
than a cult. Or to put the sense of this strategy more
generally: it tries to defend liberal education by locating the place
of liberal education *within* the world rather than apart from
it. ---And this is perhaps the most visible way that a liberal
education is now being made a matter of context rather than
content. 

[Back to top](#top)

## Part Two {#two}

By this point in my lecture, however, I think one could make
an objection. For I haven't yet given any grounds for
*worrying* about any of this. If we *have* lost the idea of
a liberal art, by making liberal education a matter of
context rather than content, then at most all I have shown
so far is that we have lost this idea deliberately, in what
might be called *an act* of forgetting. So let me now
explain my worry, which the rest of the lecture will try to
justify. My worry is that in losing this idea, more or less
deliberately, we risk another loss beyond our control: which
is to lose any way of giving a clear and compelling answer
to the question of what it means to be educated. ---Which is
to say, an answer that distinguishes liberal education from
any other form of education; and that sheds any light, in
turn, on what is lost in a choice against liberal education,
whatever might be gained. I worry, then, that once the idea
of a liberal art is lost in defense of liberal education,
the defense is lost. And once the defense is lost, liberal
education is lost.  

To begin to see all this, I want now to revisit the various
ways that defenses of liberal education have made it a matter
of context. For example: the basic set
of skills, again separated from subjects, that defenses of
liberal education claim are imparted by it. There is no doubt
that learning how to learn, along with how to read, write,
speak, and think, are useful skills; and one might even
grant their necessity for a life lived in freedom. But it is
hard to see how these skills belong to a liberal education
rather than to any education. And the more indispensable
these skills sound, the harder it is to conceive them as
liberal rather than remedial. Shouldn't we already know how
to learn, and read, write, speak, and think, before we go to
college?

There are, of course, ways to specify such skills, but they
reflect another aspect of the problem. To recall St. John's
way of doing this, in a liberal education you learn how to
speak articulately, read attentively, reason effectively,
think creatively. But are we we then to believe that you'll
be left speaking inarticulately, reading inattentively,
reasoning ineffectively, or thinking uncreatively, if you
choose another kind of education---say, to pursue a degree
in computer programming? This is doubtful. But if so, then
what again distinguishes a liberal education from any
education? 

The same problem emerges from the attempt to distinguish
a liberal education on higher-sounding grounds. In [one of
his
blogposts](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/03/11/five-reasons-to-attend-st-johns-college/?_ga=1.184745897.1475954775.1399757768),
for example, President Nelson writes: "St. John’s College is
the right fit for someone who is seeking a special sort of
education---an education in the arts of freedom, an
education in how to make learning and life their own." But
one could ask how such encompassing terms could distinguish
a St. John's education from any education, or even from
human experience as such. For isn't the distinction between
experience and innocence, or experience and endurance, found
in just the kind of learning, and living, that is
necessarily one's own? Or suppose we take our bearings from
Socrates, and claim that St. John's will teach you
intellectual courage: how to persevere in the pursuit of
knowledge rather than yield in the face of ignorance.
Perhaps St. John's will, but so then will any field of
research one might pursue, it could be argued, that relies
on science to reach its results rather than superstition.
And direct appeals to Socrates, as if the Enlightenment never
happened, won't be enough to distinguish St. John's in
particular, or liberal education more generally, on the
matter of intellectual courage. 

But there is a whole other side to this problem. Insofar as
it becomes hard to distinguish a liberal education from any
education when it is made a matter of context, it becomes
easy to make a choice against liberal education merely by
wanting an education with content. To consider this problem
from one angle, take the penchant in education nowadays for
testing and ranking and training and specializing. It may be
good and even necessary to speak against all this in defense
of liberal education. But this risks the impression that
a liberal education is an education for dilettantes,
providing an escape from being challenged or judged or
driven or dedicated. And what can be said to correct this
impression, if in a liberal education, these virtues are
matters of context rather than content? Matters, that is,
about which nothing more, really, can be said, but only
shown---where you see such students for yourself? Or even be
such a student yourself? For as one noted defender of
liberal education, Andrew Delbanco, [has put
it](http://chronicle.com/article/College-at-Risk/130893/):

> One of the difficulties in making the case
for liberal education against the rising tide of skepticism
is that it is almost impossible to persuade doubters who
have not experienced it for themselves. The Puritan founders
of our oldest colleges would have called it "such a mystery
as none can read but they that know it."

This way of putting the problem captures what is potentially
self-defeating in defenses of liberal education that make it
a matter of context. For if the point of any defense is *to
persuade* people to experience liberal education for
themselves, then how can there be a defense that depends on
such an experience to be persuasive?   

There are, of course, ways of trying to capture this
experience in images, as I earlier discussed in the case of
St. John's. But this same case reflects the problem. If we
make its education a matter of context, by showing a student
playing croquet, or reading a book on a bench near a tree,
or even speaking with passion and eloquence about how much
her education means, we haven't yet distinguished St.
John's from any other college where such things might be
said or done---even though St. John's is unique, in having
renounced the elective system and established an
all-required curriculum. But St. John's is unique, then, as
a matter of content, not context. And something similar by
way of distinction-erasing might be said of the defenses
of liberal education more generally. For if these defenses 
were products of a liberal education, one might have
expected them to reflect a diversity of views, or an
originality of thought. But so far as these defenses make
liberal education a matter of context, and speak of the kind
of skills one needs to flourish in life, it becomes hard not
to speak in platitudes or commonplaces. And indeed these
defenses more or less follow a script: In an ever-changing
world, now more than ever, we need the truly useful arts of
a liberal education. Even President Nelson hasn't quite
managed to liberate himself from this script, even though
I regard him as a gifted writer, who is making the most
of the script.   

Still, I suspect that those of us devoted to liberal
education will need more than a script to survive. And if my
lecture so far is right, this means finding what we have
lost, or recollecting what we have forgotten. So in the time
I have left, I want to sketch one way back
to the idea of a liberal art. 


[Back to top](#top)

## Part Three {#three}

To take the first step back, I want you to imagine that we
have shut every window at St. John's College, and drawn
every curtain; as if St. John's were indeed a cult. Or to
put this more generously: as if the place of liberal
education were not within the world but apart from it. But
why would we believe this? We would believe it, I think,
because of something we believed about the freedom promised
by a liberal education. We would take this freedom to be
important enough, yet fragile enough, to protect its
pursuit.  We would regard this freedom as invaluable, then,
but not indispensable. A life could be lived, and even lived
well, without it. And this would be why its pursuit would
need protection from the outside world. For it would be
a freedom that might well be forgotten in the living of
life; or even dismissed, or denied---for example, in the
choice of another form of education. Or in the quest for
power, or the drive to succeed. The kind of freedom that
someone like Meno might not want, but that his slave-boy
might need, to be free at all. The kind of freedom, then,
that might be possessed even by those in chains, or in
prison, or in poverty. The kind of freedom we can still
possess at the moment of death, when there is no life left
to live. The kind of freedom you can count on, then, not
when you might do anything, but when you can do nothing. At
moments of life when you might be said to need a useless
skill, not a useful one.

But what kind of freedom could this be? The answer
takes us a second step back. For this would be a freedom,
I think, that transcends the horizons of life, and indeed be
the freedom it is---perhaps the highest kind there is---in
having no horizons. But what does having no horizons mean?
Here is one answer, and to my mind the best answer: having
no horizons means having the truth. And a liberal education,
then, would promise you the truth. 

If this promise sounds ridiculous, then good. For if what
I have so far argued is right, then we are better off saying
ridiculous things than obvious things in defense of liberal
education. But this promise, you'll also have to admit, is
one way, and perhaps the simplest way, to claim that
a liberal education has content. And truth might be the only
way to understand a content that frees us rather than binds
us. The promise of truth should also sound attractive, at
least if there is any chance to keep the promise. But
perhaps you think no liberal arts college these days would
dare to make the promise. Well, you would be wrong. At the
time I write this sentence (which was yesterday), the
college whose curriculum most resembles St. John's had the
slogan "Truth Matters" emblazoned across [its home
page](http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/). And this same college
began [its own
defense](http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/a-liberating-education)
of liberal education by claiming that "to learn is to
discover and grow in the truth about reality. It is the
truth, and nothing less, that sets men free." 

Now, I have to admit
that the college in question is Thomas Aquinas. And perhaps
you would tell me their belief in truth is based on their
belief in Christ. I would agree, but hasten to add that St.
John's has a source of its own for a belief in truth. Which
takes us a third step back. For though 
we may not have to believe in Christ to believe in truth, perhaps we do
have to believe in Ptolemy.

But what do I mean by a belief in Ptolemy? To explain what
I mean, and to take yet another step back to the idea of
a liberal art, I'm going to turn now *not* to Ptolemy, but
instead to Socrates; and indeed, a Socrates we are all
familiar with, from Plato's *Meno*. I do this because if St.
John's can already be said to believe in anything, it
believes in this: you can only learn, truly learn, insofar
as you do this for yourself. But if Socrates's myth of
recollection to Meno can be believed, then learning for
yourself would be impossible, unless you somehow already
possessed whatever you might learn. Which is all but to say:
unless you somehow already had the truth. Of course, we
might take this myth to be merely myth; and one sign of its
doubtfulness even at St. John's can be glimpsed in what
I earlier quoted from a St. John's graduate, when she
claimed that "We must have intellectual bravery, that is,
the courage to push forward, to continue seeking truth even
in the face of doubts about its very existence."
I think Socrates's myth is meant to suggest, to the
contrary, that all doubts about truth's existence are put to
rest, as soon as we start to learn. 

But I call this a suggestion, because the proof, I suspect,
actually lies in Socrates's dramatic turn to the slave-boy,
and a shift from myth to mathematics. Which brings me to my
final step back. For it is in Socrates's encounter with the
slave-boy, I think, that we can find the lost idea of
a liberal art. And to recover it, I now offer what I call
a loose reading of this
encounter. 

The central question of this episode is: how long,
exactly, is the side of an eight-foot
square? (*Meno* 82e) Now, as you no doubt know, because the line
in question is irrational, there is no answer to the
question in terms of feet. But I prefer to put this
a different way. There *is* an answer, but only insofar as
the answer is made into a matter of research, with
a divide-and-conquer approach. And this is one way to
describe the slave-boy's initial stab at the question, when
he finds that the line in question is between 2 feet and
3 feet in length, before giving up. (84a) But under one idea of
intellectual courage, we could say, we should not give up.
And we could forge ahead, on the slave-boy's behalf, in
further research, by dividing the 3 foot line even more. And
putting the results in suitably modern terms, we learn that
the line in question is between 2.8 and 2.9 feet; then we
learn it is between 2.82 and 2.83 feet; then we learn it is
between 2.828 and 2.829 feet. Or to put what we learn still
more exactly: the first number in the length of the line is
2; and the next is 8; and the next is 2; then 8; then 4;
then 2; then 7; and so on. There would be no pattern in the
numbers thereby found, but this is what would make every
number found a genuine discovery, which carried us ever
farther in truth, leading us from one learned thing to the
next. We could even say we were learning for ourselves, and
persevering in the pursuit of knowledge rather than yielding
in the face of ignorance. And I think this more or less
captures the meaning of learning in what I will call the
*idea* of a field of research, which we have inherited from
modern science.  

But again, the slave-boy gives up on this approach at the
very first number 2. And Socrates doesn't exhort him to keep
at it, or show him how to divide the 3 foot line any
further. Instead, Socrates says to the slave-boy:  if you
don't want to count the line out, then just show it to me. (84a)
---It's as if Socrates had a different idea of intellectual
courage, a different idea of learning, and a different idea
of how the question should be approached, forming a different
discipline from a field of research. And I think we can
already say why. For while you can certainly make the line
in question a matter of research, you thereby put it out of
reach---as a matter of recognition. For there is no end to the
numbers you will find in the divide-and-conquer approach to
the line in question. So you are learning more and more
about an object that you will never get to see, and in that
sense, never get to know. We will always be left, as it were,
at the first number we find, with an ever-expanding but
never-vanishing horizon at the latest number we find. Or
more simply put, we will be seeking the truth, and even advancing
the truth, but never possessing the truth.

So what idea of approach does Socrates have in mind instead?
We can see it coming-to-be in the very next thing he does
with the slave-boy. For the slave-boy is truly stumped, and
can't even show the line in question. For of course it is not
in front of the slave-boy yet; and in his mind, we might
say, it is not yet a matter of recognition, but still
a matter of research, even though he's given the project up.
So in perhaps his one outright act of teaching, giving
birth, we might say, to the very idea of a liberal art,
Socrates simply draws the line in question---erasing at once
any remaining horizon of discovery, and showing we are
already in possession of the truth. (85a) And what he does in
drawing this line radically changes what it means for the
slave-boy to learn. For this is no longer to discover any
more about the line in question, but instead to recognize
the line in question. Or perhaps I should say recollect the
line in question. But in either formulation, this means
seeing that the line Socrates has drawn is indeed the line
in question. And the slave boy does this in yet another act
of recognition, when he sees that the figure Socrates draws,
upon the line that he draws, is indeed the eight-foot square
in question. 

But let me try to clarify this by generalizing it. Let us
suppose that Socrates has asked the slave-boy a more
encompassing question. Such as: "Why do the heavens move as
they do?" One way to answer this question is again to make
it a matter of research, producing fields and even
sub-fields of research, in a divide-and-conquer approach to
the question. But this risks putting the matter beyond the
reach of recognition. True, we will learn more and more
about heavenly motions in this approach; but there is no
promise that we will ever learn enough to finally answer the
question. And this reflects one way to understand learning,
leading to one interpretation of "astronomy," that we have
inherited from modern science. But there is still another
way to understand learning, leading to another
interpretation of "astronomy," that we have inherited from
ancient science, and that promises us an answer, in
promising us the truth. And a college like ours is committed
to it, I think, if we believe that learning is a finally
a matter of recognition. 

So another way of answering the question "Why do the heavens
move as they do?" that we can still call "astronomy,"
produces a liberal art. And in this approach, strange as it
may sound, we can simply answer the question, in already
possessing the truth. We don't even have to stop at one
answer: Ptolemy, as I recall, gives us two---suggesting that
the truth is more generous than frugal. And we don't even
need any telescopes. All we have to do is draw lines just
like Socrates did, that allow us to see, or more exactly see
again, the object in question. Which in this more
encompassing case is the motion of the heavens; hence we
have to draw the lines---circles, basically---that allow us
to see again, and in that sense to recognize, the very
motions of the heavens we were asking about. And in this way
we can give a true account of these motions, since this
account allows us not simply to explain what we see, as if
to move past it, but to recognize what we see, in a recovery
of it. 

But now suppose we made the question Socrates asks the
slave-boy *all*-encompassing---something like: "Why is the
world the way it is?" In one approach---let us call this
a technical education---we would be led into ever-more
numerous fields of research to answer the question, with no
promise that we will ever recover the world by the end, in
an act of recognition. But in another approach---let us call
this a liberal education---we would be led to seven liberal
arts to answer the question, where this recovery of the
world in an act of recognition is precisely the point. And
this is why, I think, these antique seven arts might still
be said to form a whole, that gives a truly liberal
education its content.

But let me say one final thing in this spirit of
recollection on behalf of St. John's College. Let us suppose
that the truth is very generous. So generous, that when we
ask the question "Why is the world the way it is?" there is
not just one answer, or two answers, or seven answers, but
something closer to a hundred. And let us suppose that the
lines that might be drawn to produce this hundred are drawn,
not to form squares, or circles, but letters; and that the
letters are suitably arranged in words, sentences,
paragraphs, to compose what we might call "books." Any of
the hundred so-called books, in that case, would allow us to
recover the world in an act of recognition. And we could
recognize the world in such a book, by reading it with the
same generosity possessed by the truth. The book would be
inescapably be full of content, in being inescapably full of
truth. These are the books I think we read at the college,
and believe in. And in being full of truth, they give, to any
conversation at the college that brings them to life,
a purpose, and a point, beyond that life; proving there is
more, even to life, than life. Truth.
