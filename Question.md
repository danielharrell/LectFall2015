## Introduction {#intro}

Tonight, I want to ask a question about questions. What are
they? What did I just do in asking that one? Or that one? Or
this one?

The questions I just asked show they are easy enough to
form. And form them we do, in ways that range from the
clearly prosaic to the seemingly profound. What did you have
for lunch today? Why is there something rather than nothing?

Questions also have a central place at this college, in
their own way as important as the books we read and the
conversations we have. There is a reason we begin seminar
with an opening question rather than presentation. Or why we
call the occasion after Friday Night Lecture the Question
Period rather than the Answer Period, or even the
Question-And-Answer Period.  Without the questions we ask,
the books we read and the conversations we have would
arguably lose their point.

But their very importance can make questions invisible to
us.  They would get in the way of themselves, it seems, if we
couldn't ask a question without having to ask, first, what
it means to ask a question. And if we consider questions our
best expressions of thoughtfulness, it is easy to focus on
what they ask, without any distinct reflection on what they
are.  One might even wonder if there is anything left in
a question to think about, once we grasp, and can ponder,
what the question is asking about.

But perhaps there *is* something left to think about.
Questions may be invisible in one sense, but they are altogether
visible in another. We give questions their own punctuation
mark; their own syntax; their own intonation; and even their
own verb, making a question something I *ask*, rather than
simply something I say. It even sounds odd to say that
questions are *said*, rather than asked. But what is it,
then, that might make asking different from saying? What did
I just do in raising a question about this
difference rather than making an assertion about it? And
what would make my question different from my answer, if
I had any answer to give? 

And *do* I have any answer to give? I ask this last
question, because I confess I can't make up my mind about
the lecture to follow, and what to make of where it goes.
I do know I've divided it into two parts. In the first part,
I will use my example of a clearly prosaic question---what
did you have for lunch today?---to describe something about
questions I find essential, yet puzzling, even paradoxical.
<!--Make sure to mention that my pronomial analysis of "What
did you have for lunch today? can be applied to questions
more generally, as their essential feature--> Then, in the
second part of the lecture, I will use my example of
a seemingly profound question---why is there something
rather than nothing?---to try to resolve the paradox. But
I will end the lecture with a question that suggests I have
failed.  <!--The lecture also has an epilogue, which I'll
read if I'm still within the hour by then.-->

## Part One {#one}

So what did you have for lunch today? Or suppose I ask you
this, and you reply: I had pizza. What makes my sentence
*the question* in this exchange? We can assume I spoke my
sentence with the right intonation; and that if I wrote my
sentence down, I would put a question-mark at the end.
I also used the verb "to do", to help invert my subject and
verb. But there is one more thing I did, another word
I used. I began my sentence with "what", as if to announce
a question rather than an answer. Perhaps what makes my
sentence *the question* in our exchange, then, has something
essential to do with my use of the word "what". So how am
I using it? 

I am using it, evidently, to ask you *what* you had for
lunch. And the grammatical role it plays in my sentence
seems clear enough. It functions, so we say, as a pronoun.
And this means, we might presume, that it is taking the
place of a noun. But what noun? Again, we might presume this
would be whatever noun, or noun-phrase, identifies what you
had for lunch. In this case, then, the noun would be
"pizza." 

But there is already a problem with this analysis, or at
least a puzzle. It gives a fair enough explanation, I think,
of how you might use the pronoun "what" in your answer; for
example, if you were to say: "what I had for lunch today was
pizza". But since my question precedes your answer, and
prompts your answer, it presumably makes sense in advance of
your answer, no matter the answer, even if the answer were
"I had nothing for lunch today; I was too busy to eat." But
this suggests that when I use the pronoun "what" in my
question, it cannot take the place of *any* noun, lest my
question imply your answer. 

But then am I *not* using the word "what" in my question as
a pronoun? There is a problem with this possibility, too.
For even if my question makes sense in advance of any
answer, it still asks for
an answer; and in this case for the very answer you give
about what you had for lunch. Indeed, in this direction, we
might say that the noun "pizza" is too general, rather than
too specific, to have been replaced by the
pronoun "what" in my question. After all, in asking you what
you had for lunch, I am asking you about the very piece of
pizza you had for lunch, all other pizza aside. 

But what should we make, then, of my use of the word "what"?
If my question is to make sense in advance of your answer,
then this pronoun, if it *is* a pronoun, will have represent
*whatever* you might have had for lunch, as if its reference
to your lunch were indefinite. Yet if my question is to make
sense as *asking* for your answer, then this pronoun will
have to represent *exactly* what you had for lunch, as if
its reference to your lunch were definite, even unique. And
since I only have to ask the question once, we can assume
that the word "what" is somehow making both references at
once, as if it could take the place of any lunch you might
have had, and the one lunch you actually had, at the very same
time. But what kind of pronoun is that?

There is another pronoun like this in my question, related
to the first. For my question is about what *you* had for
lunch. Evidently, I can use the pronoun "you", without any
dependence on a name it might have replaced, to address my
question to each of you, as if my reference to you both
included and excluded anyone else, at least in the audience.
And this seems something like the way I can use the pronoun
"what", again without any dependence on a noun it might have
replaced, to ask my question about *what* you had for lunch,
as if my reference to your lunch both included and excluded
anything else, at least that was edible and available. And
there is yet another word in the most explicit form of my
question, the word "today", that seems to make the same
double reference, as if it too were the same kind of
pronoun. <!--Perhaps put "today" in nearby formulation of
question?--> For there is no date that the word "today" need
take the place of; and this allows it to refer to any day,
even in referring to just one.   

But let me pause at this point in my account. For I can see
at least two issues with it. One is that it might be wrong,
in part or whole, about the use of pronouns in my question.
Another issue is that the account focuses on one question,
but says nothing about questions more generally. So let me
now try to describe what puzzles me about questions more
generally, and without appeal to any pronouns, before moving
on to the second part of my lecture.  

Again, my question was, "What did you have for lunch today?"
And when I began my account of what puzzled me about it,
I said that the question had to make sense in two ways at
once: it had to make sense, first, *in advance of* any
answer;  and it *also* had to make sense *as asking for* an
answer. But I might have said this much of *any* question,
and this much is enough to puzzle me.  For by making sense
in advance of any answer, a question seems to be complete;
yet by making sense as asking for an answer, a question
seems to be incomplete. And if it makes sense in both ways
at once, then a question seems somehow complete and
incomplete at once. But this sounds paradoxical rather than
possible. So how is it possible? How are *questions*
possible?   

And in particular, how is the kind of question we ask at the
college possible? For the kind of question I asked you about
your lunch, we might say, is a question for me, but not for
you; and it asks for an answer possessed by you, but not by
me. But the kind of question we ask the college---for
example, in the opening question of a seminar---is more
radical. It is a question for *all* of us, *before* the
conversation begins, that asks for an answer possessed by
none of us, which is *why* the conversation begins. But
questions without answers in this sense might well be
dismissed as hopeless, pointless, useless, meaningless---as
if these were questions for none of us rather than all of
us, in asking for answers possessed by none of us.
This, then, is the paradox. For if a question is so
incomplete as to ask for an answer in no one's possession,
then how can it still be complete enough to *be* a question?
how is this kind of question even possible?

The epitome of such a question is my example of a seemingly
profound question: Why is there something rather than
nothing? For any answer to this question---be it cause or
reason---would seem to involve something rather than
nothing, which the question then obliges us to explain, in
yet another answer, leading to an infinite regress of
answers, as if the question were asking for an answer only
to swallow it, so that no one could ever possess it. But
does this mean that the question is truly profound? Even the
deepest question there is? Or does it mean that the question
is not really a question at all?

## Part Two {#two}

So why *is* there something rather than nothing? Or leaving
aside any prospect of an answer, why would I ever ask myself
this question? One reason, I think, involves the very point
of view from which I asked you earlier what you had for
lunch. This is the point of view that allowed me to address
you with the pronoun "you", and the point of view, then,
that allows me to use the pronoun "I", or "me", to address
myself. 

Here is one way to think about this. When I ask why there is
something rather than nothing, I don't mean to ask merely
why there is something rather than something *else*. It is
one thing to ask myself why there is a podium in front of me
rather than something else, like a table, or a chair, or
even just the air in the hall. But it seems another thing to
ask myself why there is a podium in front of me rather than
nothing at all. But what might lead me from the first kind
of question to the second? What might lead me, that is, to
suppose it possible, or even intelligible, that
something in the world like the podium might be nothing,
rather than merely something else? Can I even use the word
"nothing" and *not* mean something?    

But suppose I ask myself why the person *behind*
this podium is me, rather than someone else. In one
sense, the answer is easy to give. It was *my* lecture
scheduled for tonight rather than someone
else's. And *my* decision to give a lecture that led to the
scheduling. The answer to my question might continue in this
vein, going back in time to my appointment at the college,
to my birth, my parents' birth, my grandparents', all the
way back to the Big Bang, if you like. But even this
much an answer seems to leave something in my question
unaddressed. For why am *I* the person that this answer puts
so conclusively behind the podium? Why is his point of view
*my* point of view? Why is *his* lecture *mine*? Why is he
*me*?  

The person behind this podium, I can grant, is definitely me
rather than someone else. But it seems I can still ask *why*
this person is me: as if he, too, might be someone else, not
in the sense that he replaced me, but instead in the sense
that he erased me; leaving me nowhere rather than somewhere,
no one rather than someone, nothing rather than something.
So when I ask myself why the person behind this podium is me
*even if* I *am* no one else, I seem to be asking why *I
myself* am something rather than nothing. And the reason
I can ask this is related to my use of the first-person
pronoun in my question, and the point of view upon the world
it reflects. Because my use of it allows the pronoun to
refer to me and no one else, it reflects a point of view
upon the world that I share with no one else. It is the
point of view I can call my own. Of course, you
also possess your own point of view in this sense---each of
you, I mean. And this is why you too can use the pronoun "I"
to mean you and no one else. 

Yet since each of us shares this point of view with no one
else, the view itself seems to be something that could never
*be* something else. That is, my own point of view upon the
world, since I share this with no one else, can only be
something or nothing. And the reason I can ask myself why
*I* am something rather than nothing, it seems, is that I am
asking this question not only *from* my own point of view,
but *about* this point of view, and why the view is something
rather than nothing in being *mine*.    

But this is also the reason, then, that I can ask why there
is something rather than nothing more generally. For my own
point of view upon the world might be said to *contain* the
world, as if in a frame; even if I am otherwise *contained*
in the world as an inhabitant. The world is made
*present* to me through this point of view; and the world
has a *presence*, then, that we can distinguish from its
existence. But presence, in this sense, is presence rather
than absence, or something rather than nothing.  So my own
point of view upon the world is what makes anything I might
encounter in it, like the podium in front of me, present
rather than absent, or something rather than nothing. And
I can make the podium vanish, in this sense, simply by
closing my eyes. And once they close for good, I can lose
tthe world altogether. So why I ever *gained* the world in
this sense, why I ever found myself with eyes to open, is
one way to think about how I might come to ask myself, and
feel compelled to ask myself, why there is something rather
than nothing. 

Even so, it seems I have no hope of finding any answer. For
if we take something rather than nothing to mean
presence rather than absence, then asking *why* there is
something rather than nothing, at least if I hope to find an
answer, is like asking for the *source* of presence to
present itself to me, as if it were no longer a source. Or
like asking for the origin of my own point of view upon the
world to become *part* of that point of view, as if it were
no longer an origin. So we again seem stuck in paradox, and
stuck with the same question about questions that concluded
the first part of my lecture. If a question is so
incomplete as to ask for an answer in no one's possession,
then how can it still be complete enough to *be* a question?
How are questions without answers in this sense even
possible?

But there is another way to think about this. What if I can
never *find* an answer to this question, because in some
sense I *am* the answer. What if there *were* no origin of
my own point of view upon the world, because the point of
view itself *is* an origin? What if a question *could* ask
for an answer in no one's possession and still *be*
a question, in being the source of the answer it was asking
for? What if questions without answers were possible,
because questions without answers were beginnings?  

I can try to clarify my "what-ifs" through an example.
Suppose at some point this week you wanted to know, but
didn't know, who the Friday Night lecturer was. If you asked
anyone else who knew, they would say "Mr Harrell is". But if
you came to me, I would say "I am". The answers are the same
in one sense, but their grammar still reflects a difference.
And one way to put this difference, I think, is that the
first answer, the one that refers to me as Mr Harrell, is an
answer anyone might have, or give. But the second answer,
the one that refers to me by the pronoun "I", is an answer
only I can give. And while in one sense I might be said to
have it; in another sense, and I think this is a more exact
sense, I don't *have* the answer, because I *am* the answer. 

This is one example, then, where where we might say lacking
the answer means being the answer. But something similar,
I think, is happening in questions where no one has an
answer. Take the question of my lecture: "what is
a question?" Let us assume there are no experts on
questions to consult, no Google search we could do, no
answer "out there" to find, to put this question to rest.
But what answer, then, could the question be asking for?
This is where I think it makes a kind of sense to say that
lacking the answer means being the answer. Or to try to make
this more intelligible, and particular: when we ask the kind
of question that can become a question for all of us, before the
conversation begins, and it asks for an answer possessed by
none of us, which is why the conversation begins, the answer
*may well be* the conversation, as if answering a question were like
answering a call or summons. And to dismiss questions
without answers in this sense as hopeless, or pointless, or
useless, or meaningless, would be heedless of the call. 

But in case this sounds too much like a platitude for the
good of seminar, I have a more heretical way of describing
the kind of question we ask at the college. For suppose it
true that questions without answers in this sense are
possible, because questions without answers are beginnings.
This suggests that such questions, in *being* beginnings,
have no past. They can never be asked again, without being
asked anew. But then for any book of the past we read, there
is no way *back* to the author's meaning or intent. Or at
least, there is no way back to it, when you read that book
in light of any question that has truly become a question
for you, even if the author has asked it too. For since
questions like this can only be asked again in being asked
anew, everything you do with the book in this light becomes
a part of *your* answer to the question, as if the author
had been left behind. And since this would be just as true for the
author, in relation to past authors, it would seem as if no
author could ever disagree with another. It would be
mistaken, then, to suppose that a disagreement among answers
distinguishes the kind of question we ask at the college. 

But to conclude my lecture, I now want to ask two questions
about my lecture. 

The first question has to do with my account of the pronoun
"I". My use of this pronoun, I said, to refer to myself and
no one else, meant that I have a point of view upon the
world that I share with no one else. But if so, then what
point of view upon the world *do* I share with someone else
when both of us can use the pronoun "we"? ---Such as when a
question becomes one for all of us? Or to make my 
question more particular: in what sense do we form a "we",
and not simply a "you and I", when we have a conversation?  

My second question has to do with my way of resolving the
paradox about questions as I characterized it in this
lecture. The paradox, to recall, was that questions were
complete and incomplete at once: complete in making sense in
advance of any answer; and incomplete in making sense as
asking for an answer. My way of resolving this paradox was
to identify questions with beginnings. In one sense, I think
the resolution succeeds. For the way a question can make
a beginning, we might say, is when the one who asks is the
one who answers; and *what* the question asks for, then, is
not an object without, but rather an act within. Still,
I suspect this resolution fails in another sense. For
beginnings can seem just as paradoxical as questions:
a beginning must follow nothing, and in that sense depend on
nothing, as if it were complete; yet a beginning is followed
by something, and in that sense depends on something, as if
it were complete. So how are beginnings possible?
